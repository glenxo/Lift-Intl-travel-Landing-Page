                  have the best possible experience. Whether you're a seasoned angler or just starting, finding the right 
                  fishing charter can make all the difference. Luckily, there are plenty of charters available to cater to

                  charter that can take you to more challenging fishing spots or provide specialized equipment. Whatever 
                  your level of expertise, be sure to communicate your expectations with your charter company beforehand 
                  to ensure they can accommodate your needs. This way, you can make the most of your fishing trip and 
                  create unforgettable memories with your friends and family.

            <h2>Currency</h2>
                <p>When planning a trip to Panama, it's important to note that the country uses 
                  the US dollar as its official currency. This makes it convenient for travelers 
                  from the United States or other countries where the US dollar is the primary currency. 
                  However, it's essential to have cash or a credit card that works internationally to avoid 
                  any inconveniences during your trip.  <br/><br/> It's also worth noting that some establishments may only
                  accept cash, so having some on hand is advisable. You can exchange your currency for US dollars 
                  at local banks or currency exchange centers, but it's recommended to do so before traveling to 
                  avoid any additional fees. By being prepared with the right form of payment, you can enjoy your 
                  trip to Panama without any financial hiccups.</p>
