            <p class="text">No discussion about the Panama Canal would be complete without acknowledging the unique 
                community of "Zonians." Historically, the Zonians were American citizens residing in the Panama Canal 
                Zone during its US-controlled era. Their presence had a profound influence on the region, fostering a 
                vibrant cultural fusion of American and Panamanian traditions. Although the Canal Zone was officially 
                handed over to Panama in 1999, the legacy of the Zonians and their contributions to the development of 
                the Canal remains an integral part of its history</p>

            <h3 class="title">Today's Administration and Contribution to the Economy:</h3>
            <p class="text">In the present era, the administration of the Panama Canal has been transferred to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP). Under the ACP's stewardship, the Canal continues to play a pivotal role in global maritime trade and contributes significantly to the Panamanian economy. It serves as a crucial link connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, facilitating the efficient movement of goods between continents. The revenue generated from tolls paid by ships passing through the Canal fuels infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and other key sectors, bolstering Panama's economic growth.</p>
