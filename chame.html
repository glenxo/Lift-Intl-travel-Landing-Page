    <p class="address">Panama city, Banking zone, Via espana</p>
    <p>When visiting natural areas like Los Cajones de Chame, it is important to follow the designated 
      trails and respect any signs or barriers in the area. These signs and barriers are put in place 
      for the safety of visitors and the preservation of the natural environment.<br>

      By staying on the designated trails, visitors can help prevent erosion and protect the delicate 
      ecosystem of the area. Additionally, staying on the trails can help visitors avoid any potential 
      hazards or dangerous areas.<br><br>
      
      Respecting any signs or barriers is also important as it may indicate that an area is sensitive, 
      sacred, or under restoration. Visitors should avoid these areas to ensure that they do not disturb 
      any important habitats or cultural sites.<br>
      
      By following the designated trails and respecting any signs or barriers, visitors can help 
      protect the natural beauty and cultural significance of Los Cajones de Chame for future

    <h3 class="name">Take only memories and leave only footprints.</h3>
    <p class="address">Panama city, Calle 50</p>
    <p>The phrase "Take only memories and leave only footprints" is a common mantra for responsible outdoor 
      recreation. When visiting natural areas like Los Cajones de Chame, it is important to practice this 
      principle to help preserve the beauty and integrity of the environment.<br>

      This means that visitors should refrain from taking anything from the area, including plants, rocks, 
      or artifacts. Additionally, visitors should properly dispose of any waste and leave the 
      area as they found it.<br><br>
      
      By taking only memories and leaving only footprints, visitors can help ensure that future 
      generations can enjoy the area as well. It also shows respect for the natural environment 
      and the cultural significance of the area.<br>

    <h3 class="name">Wear sturdy, comfortable shoes suitable for hiking and water activities</h3>
    <p class="address">Panama city, 53rd St ave</p>
    <p>Isla Grande, Panama, has a tropical climate, which means high temperatures and humidity levels throughout 
        the year. When visiting Isla Grande, it's essential to pack lightweight, breathable clothing to stay 
        comfortable in the heat. It's also crucial to plan your activities accordingly to avoid the hottest part 
        of the day, typically from midday until late afternoon. During these hours, it's best to relax in the 
        shade or cool off in the water.<br><br>

        In addition to packing the right clothing, it's important to bring other essentials to stay comfortable 
        in the heat. Sunscreen, hats, and sunglasses can protect you from the strong tropical sun, while mosquito 
        repellent can help keep pests at bay. It's also a good idea to bring a refillable water bottle to stay 
        hydrated throughout the day, as the heat and humidity can quickly lead to dehydration.<br>
        
        By being mindful of the weather and packing accordingly, you can make the most of your trip to Isla Grande 
        while staying comfortable and safe in the tropical climate.</p>

    <h3 class="name">Avoid littering and dispose of waste properly.</h3>
    <p class="address">Panama city, Calle 50 - Casa La Guama</p>
    <p>When visiting Los Cajones de Chame, it is important to avoid littering and dispose of waste properly. 
      Littering can have negative impacts on the natural environment, wildlife, and even human health.<br>

      Visitors should pack out all of their trash and dispose of it in proper receptacles. If trash cans are 
      not available, visitors should bring their waste with them and dispose of it in a proper facility.<br><br>
      
      Additionally, visitors should avoid leaving any other waste behind, including toilet paper 
      and hygiene products. These items can take years to decompose and harm the natural environment.<br>
      
      By avoiding littering and properly disposing of waste, visitors can help preserve the 
      natural beauty of Los Cajones de Chame and ensure that future generations can enjoy it as well..</p>
