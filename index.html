      Please try to hop on the transport headed to where you are going, aiming the time of departure by 13:20 hrs AGW, from the Holiday 
      Inn Ciudad del Saber. As we have learned, the larger the group the better the fun, therefore, we are going to customize your afternoons 
      so that you can all ride together as much as possible. Once we know how many you will be in each group for airport, meals and excursions, 
      we will determine how well the price spreads out for 1-70 travelers (understanding that we can do a private tour, but the price is better 
      the more you are as well), we will be using the preferred contact method in order to inform you the final cost and to collect, like this:
      Down payment  is 50% of the total cost, and The other 50% will be an authorization/hold on your card, for the 20% discount make sure to do 
      this before the 20th of January, 2023 (this amount is refundable if cancelation is made at least 7 days before the scheduled service).</p>
