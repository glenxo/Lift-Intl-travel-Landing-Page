            <h2>Consider visiting during the Dry Season</h2>
                <p>If you're planning to visit the Panama Canal, consider visiting during the dry season, 
                  which runs from December to April. During this time, there is less rainfall and a higher 
                  chance of seeing ship transits, which can be an exciting sight to witness. Keep in mind 
                  that the weather can still be hot and humid, so be sure to pack accordingly. <br/><br/>

                  Additionally, visiting during the dry season can also make it easier to explore other 
                  nearby attractions, such as the nearby National Park of Soberania or the Causeway Islands. 
                  Make sure to check the weather forecast before your trip and plan your itinerary accordingly 
                  to make the most out of your visit to this incredible engineering feat.</p>
