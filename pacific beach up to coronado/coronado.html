          with many retirees and digital nomads choosing to make <br/>Coronado their permanent home. This has led to a<br/> 
          thriving restaurant scene, with a <br/>range of international and local cuisine available.<br/><br/>
          
          If you're looking for outdoor activities, Coronado has plenty to offer. <br/>Take a hike through the surrounding 
          mountains, go birdwatching in the nearby <br/>wetlands, or try your hand at deep-sea fishing in the Pacific Ocean.<br/>
          
          So if you're looking for a tropical paradise <br/>with a welcoming community, <br/>stunning beaches, and plenty of
