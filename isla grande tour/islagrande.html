          <h2> Bring a waterproof camera to capture the island's stunning natural beauty</h2>
              <p>When visiting Isla Grande, bringing a waterproof camera is a must. 
                This tropical paradise is home to some of the most stunning natural beauty in the world, 
                from crystal-clear waters to lush vegetation and exotic wildlife. <br>
                Capturing these breathtaking sights and moments is essential to preserve the memories of your trip.

                A waterproof camera is especially important because Isla Grande offers many water-based activities, 
                such as swimming, snorkeling, and scuba diving. A standard camera can easily get damaged if it gets wet, 
                making it useless for capturing those memorable moments. A waterproof camera will allow you to take 
                stunning underwater shots and protect your camera from water damage.<br><br>
                
                Moreover, the island's natural beauty is best captured in photographs, which can be shared with 
                family and friends or used as a reminder of your unforgettable trip to Isla Grande. 
                So, don't forget to pack your waterproof camera and make the most of your time on this tropical paradise.</p>

          <h2> Avoid touching or stepping on coral reefs or other marine life to protect their habitats</h2>
              <p>One of the most important things to keep in mind when visiting Isla Grande is to avoid touching or 
                stepping on coral reefs or other marine life. Coral reefs are an essential part of the ocean ecosystem, 
                and they provide a habitat for numerous species of fish and other marine life. These delicate ecosystems 
                can easily be damaged by human contact, and it can take years or even decades for them to recover.<br><br>

                Stepping on coral reefs or touching marine life can not only cause physical damage but also introduce 
                harmful bacteria and chemicals that can harm the reef and its inhabitants. Therefore, it's important 
                to stay alert and be mindful of your surroundings when swimming, snorkeling, or diving. <br>
                By respecting the marine life and their habitats, we can help to preserve the beauty and 
                diversity of Isla Grande's underwater world for future generations to enjoy.</p>

          <h2> Bring cash as there are limited ATMs on the island</h2>
              <p>When planning a trip to Isla Grande, it's important to remember to bring cash. The island is relatively 
                small and has limited ATMs, so it's best to be prepared to avoid any potential inconveniences during your stay.
                <br>
                Cash is necessary for a variety of expenses, such as purchasing meals, souvenirs, and paying for 
                water-based activities. Some establishments may accept credit cards, but it's always better to 
                have cash on hand as a backup. It's also a good idea to bring smaller denominations, as larger 
                bills may be harder to change.<br><br>
                
                Having cash readily available will ensure that you don't have to waste time searching for ATMs 
                or worry about running out of money during your stay. So, make sure to plan accordingly and 
                bring enough cash to cover your expenses while on the beautiful island of Isla Grande.</p>

          <h2> Apply sunscreen and insect repellent to protect your skin from the sun and bugs</h2>
              <p>When visiting Isla Grande, it's important to protect your skin from the sun and bugs by applying 
                sunscreen and insect repellent. The island's tropical climate and beautiful beaches make it an ideal 
                location for outdoor activities, but it's essential to take proper precautions 
                to avoid skin damage and bug bites.<br>

                Sunscreen with a high SPF rating should be applied regularly, especially during peak sun hours, 
                to protect against harmful UV rays. Insect repellent will help to keep bugs at bay and prevent 
                bites that can cause itching, irritation, or even disease.<br><br>
                
                Choosing products that are environmentally friendly and biodegradable can also help to 
                preserve the island's natural beauty and protect marine life. By being mindful of your 
                personal care products, you can enjoy your time on Isla Grande while also being respectful of the environment.</p>

          <h2>Avoid littering and dispose of waste properly to preserve the island's natural beauty</h2>
              <p>Preserving the natural beauty of Isla Grande is essential to ensuring that future generations 
                can continue to enjoy its stunning landscapes and crystal-clear waters. To do your part, 
                it's important to avoid littering and dispose of waste properly while on the island.<br>

                This means not leaving any trash on the beach or in the water, and properly disposing 
                of any waste in designated trash bins. When participating in water-based activities, 
                be sure to follow proper disposal guidelines for any equipment, such as snorkeling gear or kayaks.<br><br>
                
                By being responsible and respectful of the environment, you can help to protect the 
                delicate ecosystems of Isla Grande and promote sustainable tourism practices. <br>
                It's up to all visitors to take care of this beautiful island paradise, 
                so remember to leave nothing behind except footprints in the sand.</p>

          <h2>Enjoy the local culture and customs of the island's Afro-Panamanian community</h2>
              <p>One of the highlights of visiting Isla Grande is the opportunity to experience the unique 
                culture and customs of its Afro-Panamanian community. From the vibrant music and dance to 
                the delicious local cuisine, there's so much to explore and appreciate.<br>

                It's important to approach the local culture with an open mind and respectful attitude. 
                Engaging with the community in a positive and curious way can lead to meaningful experiences and connections.<br>
                
                Consider trying local dishes, attending traditional celebrations, or purchasing 
                handicrafts made by local artisans. By supporting the local economy and celebrating 
                the community's culture, you can help to promote sustainable tourism and preserve the 
                island's traditions for future generations.<br><br>
                
                Remember to always ask permission before taking photos or entering private property, 
                and to be respectful of any customs or beliefs that may differ from your own.
