    <h3 class="name">Avoid touching or stepping on coral reefs or other marine life to protect their habitats</h3>
    <p class="address">Panama city, Banking zone, Via espana</p>
    <p>
      <p>One of the most important things to keep in mind when visiting Isla Grande is to avoid touching or 
        stepping on coral reefs or other marine life. Coral reefs are an essential part of the ocean ecosystem, 
        and they provide a habitat for numerous species of fish and other marine life. These delicate ecosystems 
        can easily be damaged by human contact, and it can take years or even decades for them to recover.<br><br>

        Stepping on coral reefs or touching marine life can not only cause physical damage but also introduce 
        harmful bacteria and chemicals that can harm the reef and its inhabitants. Therefore, it's important 
        to stay alert and be mindful of your surroundings when swimming, snorkeling, or diving. <br>
        By respecting the marine life and their habitats, we can help to preserve the beauty and 
        diversity of Isla Grande's underwater world for future generations to enjoy.</p>

    <h3 class="name">Bring cash as there are limited ATMs on the island</h3>
    <p class="address">Panama city, Calle 50</p>
    <p>
      <p>When planning a trip to Isla Grande, it's important to remember to bring cash. The island is relatively 
        small and has limited ATMs, so it's best to be prepared to avoid any potential inconveniences during your stay.
        <br>
        Cash is necessary for a variety of expenses, such as purchasing meals, souvenirs, and paying for 
        water-based activities. Some establishments may accept credit cards, but it's always better to 
        have cash on hand as a backup. It's also a good idea to bring smaller denominations, as larger 
        bills may be harder to change.<br><br>
        
        Having cash readily available will ensure that you don't have to waste time searching for ATMs 
        or worry about running out of money during your stay. So, make sure to plan accordingly and 
        bring enough cash to cover your expenses while on the beautiful island of Isla Grande.</p>

    <h3 class="name">Apply sunscreen and insect repellent to protect your skin from the sun and bugs</h3>
    <p class="address">Panama city, 53rd St ave</p>
    <p>
      <p>When visiting Isla Grande, it's important to protect your skin from the sun and bugs by applying 
        sunscreen and insect repellent. The island's tropical climate and beautiful beaches make it an ideal 
        location for outdoor activities, but it's essential to take proper precautions 
        to avoid skin damage and bug bites.<br>

        Sunscreen with a high SPF rating should be applied regularly, especially during peak sun hours, 
        to protect against harmful UV rays. Insect repellent will help to keep bugs at bay and prevent 
        bites that can cause itching, irritation, or even disease.<br><br>
        
        Choosing products that are environmentally friendly and biodegradable can also help to 
        preserve the island's natural beauty and protect marine life. By being mindful of your 
        personal care products, you can enjoy your time on Isla Grande while also being respectful of the environment.</p>

    <h3 class="name">Enjoy the local culture and customs of the island's Afro-Panamanian community</h3>
    <p class="address">Panama city, Calle 50 - Casa La Guama</p>
    <p>
      <p>One of the highlights of visiting Isla Grande is the opportunity to experience the unique 
        culture and customs of its Afro-Panamanian community. From the vibrant music and dance to 
        the delicious local cuisine, there's so much to explore and appreciate.<br>

        It's important to approach the local culture with an open mind and respectful attitude. 
        Engaging with the community in a positive and curious way can lead to meaningful experiences and connections.<br>
        
        Consider trying local dishes, attending traditional celebrations, or purchasing 
        handicrafts made by local artisans. By supporting the local economy and celebrating 
        the community's culture, you can help to promote sustainable tourism and preserve the 
        island's traditions for future generations.<br><br>
        
        Remember to always ask permission before taking photos or entering private property, 
        and to be respectful of any customs or beliefs that may differ from your own. 
        With an open heart and a willingness to learn, you can enjoy a truly authentic experience on Isla Grande.
