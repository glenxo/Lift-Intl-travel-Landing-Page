        <div>
        <p>Panama Viejo is an important historical site located in Panama City, Panama.<br/> 
          It was founded in 1519 by Spanish explorers, making it the oldest European settlement<br/> 
          on the Pacific coast of the Americas. The city was destroyed in 1671 by the infamous<br/>
          pirate Henry Morgan, and the Spanish moved their capital to a new location, <br/>
          which is now known as Casco Viejo.<br/>

          Today, Panama Viejo is a fascinating archaeological site that showcases the <br/>
          remains of the old city. Visitors can explore the ruins of the cathedral, the convent,<br/> 
          and the governor's palace. There are also several museums on site that provide insight <br/>
          into the history of the city, including the Museum of Panama Viejo and the Museum of Religious Art.<br/>
          
          One of the most striking features of Panama Viejo is the Torre de la Catedral, <br/>
          a tower that was once part of the old cathedral. It stands as a lone reminder of <br/>
          the grandeur of the city before its destruction.<br/>
          
          Panama Viejo is an important part of Panama's cultural heritage, and a must-see <br/>
          destination for anyone interested in history and archaeology. The site is easily <br/>
          accessible by public transportation, and guided tours are available for those who <br/>
          want a more in-depth experience. Whether you're a history buff or just curious about <br/>
          the past, a visit to Panama Viejo is sure to be a memorable experience..</p>

            <h2>Climbing the Torre de la Catedral </h2>
                <p>Climbing the Torre de la Catedral is a must-do when visiting Panama Viejo. 
                  The tower is the only remaining part of the old cathedral, and it offers a 
                  breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding area. From the top of the tower, 
                  you can see the ruins of the old city, the Pacific Ocean, and the modern skyline 
                  of Panama City. It's a great opportunity to appreciate the history and beauty of 
                  the site from a unique vantage point. The climb up the tower can be challenging, 
                  but the view is well worth it. Don't forget to bring a camera to capture the 
                  stunning views from the top.!

            <h2>Experience Level</h2>
                <p>When planning your deep-sea fishing adventure, it's essential to consider your experience level to 
                  have the best possible experience. Whether you're a seasoned angler or just starting, finding the right 
                  fishing charter can make all the difference. Luckily, there are plenty of charters available to cater to 
                  every skill level. If you're a beginner, you might prefer a charter that provides more guidance and 
                  instruction on basic fishing techniques. <br/><br/>On the other hand, if you're experienced, you might want a 
                  charter that can take you to more challenging fishing spots or provide specialized equipment. Whatever 
                  your level of expertise, be sure to communicate your expectations with your charter company beforehand 
                  to ensure they can accommodate your needs. This way, you can make the most of your fishing trip and 
                  create unforgettable memories with your friends and family.

            <h2>Safety Equipment</h2>
                <p>When planning for your deep-sea fishing adventure, safety should always be a top priority. 
                  Before booking your trip, make sure the charter provides all necessary safety equipment, including life 
                  jackets and first aid kits. This will give you peace of mind knowing that you and your fellow anglers 
                  are prepared for any unexpected situations that may arise. It's important to remember that the ocean 
                  can be unpredictable, so being well-equipped can make all the difference.<br/><br/>  Don't hesitate to ask the 
                  charter company about their safety protocols and equipment before booking your trip. Additionally, 
                  make sure to follow all safety instructions provided by your tour guide or captain while on board. 
                  By prioritizing safety, you can ensure a fun and enjoyable fishing experience for everyone involved.</p>
