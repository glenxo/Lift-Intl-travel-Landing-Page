        <p>Panama Viejo is an important historical site located in Panama City, Panama.<br/> 
          It was founded in 1519 by Spanish explorers, making it the oldest European settlement<br/> 
          on the Pacific coast of the Americas. The city was destroyed in 1671 by the infamous<br/>
          pirate Henry Morgan, and the Spanish moved their capital to a new location, <br/>
          which is now known as Casco Viejo.<br/>

          Today, Panama Viejo is a fascinating archaeological site that showcases the <br/>
          remains of the old city. Visitors can explore the ruins of the cathedral, the convent,<br/> 
          and the governor's palace. There are also several museums on site that provide insight <br/>
          into the history of the city, including the Museum of Panama Viejo and the Museum of Religious Art.<br/>
          
          One of the most striking features of Panama Viejo is the Torre de la Catedral, <br/>
          a tower that was once part of the old cathedral. It stands as a lone reminder of <br/>
          the grandeur of the city before its destruction.<br/>
          
          Panama Viejo is an important part of Panama's cultural heritage, and a must-see <br/>
          destination for anyone interested in history and archaeology. The site is easily <br/>
          accessible by public transportation, and guided tours are available for those who <br/>
          want a more in-depth experience. Whether you're a history buff or just curious about <br/>
          the past, a visit to Panama Viejo is sure to be a memorable experience..</p>
