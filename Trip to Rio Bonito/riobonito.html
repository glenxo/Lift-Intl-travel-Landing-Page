            <h2>Wear comfortable and sturdy shoes</h2>
                <p>When visiting natural areas like Rio Bonito in Chepo, wearing comfortable and sturdy shoes suitable 
                  for hiking is crucial to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience. It's important to choose footwear 
                  that is appropriate for the terrain you'll be navigating, as well as providing support and protection 
                  for your feet.<br/>

                  Hiking shoes or boots with good traction are recommended, as they provide stability and 
                  grip on uneven or slippery surfaces. Additionally, they protect your feet from rocks, thorns, 
                  and other hazards you may encounter on the trail.<br/>
                  
                  Wearing comfortable shoes that fit well can also prevent blisters and other foot injuries. 
                  It's a good idea to break in new shoes before your trip to ensure they're comfortable and won't 
                  cause any discomfort during your hikes.<br/>
                  
                  Overall, investing in a good pair of hiking shoes or boots is a wise decision for anyone
