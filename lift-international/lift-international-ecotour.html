    <img src="/soberania fishing eco tour/media/media/sportfish-fishes_3.jpg" class="image" alt="">
    <h3 class="name">Knowing the fish species</h3>
    <p class="address">Panama city, Banking zone, Via espana</p>
    <p>Knowing the fish species in Lake Gatun is crucial to a successful fishing trip. 
      The lake is home to a variety of fish species, including peacock bass, snook, tarpon, and tilapia, 
      among others. Different fish species have different feeding patterns and habitats, so it is important 
      to know which species you are targeting and what kind of bait and lures to use. <br/><br/>
      Peacock bass, for example, 
      are aggressive predators that feed on smaller fish and insects, so using topwater lures or live bait can be 
      effective. On the other hand, tilapia are herbivores that feed on plants and algae, so using soft plastic 
      baits or worms can be more successful. Knowing the fish species in Lake Gatun and their behaviors can greatly 
      increase your chances of a successful fishing trip.

    <h3 class="name">Fishing Gear and equipment is included as courtesy of lift-intl</h3>
    <p class="address">Panama city, Calle 50</p>
    <p>When it comes to fishing in Lake Gatun, having the right gear and equipment is essential to a 
      successful trip. That's why it's great to know that some organizations, such as Lift-Int'l, include 
      fishing gear as a courtesy to their guests. <br/><br/>
      This means that you don't have to worry about bringing your 
      own gear or renting it separately. Lift-Int'l offers a variety of fishing equipment, such as fishing rods, 
      reels, and lures, so you can have everything you need for your fishing trip. Having the right gear can 
      also help make your fishing experience more comfortable and enjoyable. With Lift-Int'l, you can rest assured 
      that you have everything you need to have a great time fishing in Lake Gatun.

    <h3 class="name">Checking the weather</h3>
    <p class="address">Panama city, 53rd St ave</p>
    <p>Checking the weather is an important consideration before heading out for a fishing trip in Lake Gatun. 
      The weather can have a significant impact on the fishing conditions and your overall experience. 
      Rainy and stormy weather can cause the water levels to rise and become murky, making it difficult 
      for fish to see bait and lures. Additionally, rough water can make it difficult to maneuver your boat 
      and increase the risk of accidents. <br/><br/> 
      On the other hand, calm and sunny weather can make for ideal fishing 
      conditions. It's important to check the weather forecast beforehand and plan your fishing trip accordingly. 
      If the weather conditions are unfavorable, consider rescheduling your trip for a better day. By checking the 
      weather and planning accordingly, you can increase your chances of a successful and enjoyable fishing trip in 
      Lake Gatun.</p>

    <h3 class="name">Dress appropriately</h3>
    <p class="address">Panama city, Calle 50 - Casa La Guama</p>
    <p>Dressing appropriately for a fishing trip in Lake Gatun is important for both comfort and safety. 
      The weather can be unpredictable, so it's important to dress in layers that can be easily added or 
      removed as needed. Light and breathable clothing is also recommended to keep cool and comfortable. <br/><br/>
      Additionally, wearing the appropriate footwear is crucial for safety, as the ground around the lake 
      can be uneven and slippery. Wearing non-slip shoes or boots with good traction can help prevent slips and 
      falls. It's also important to wear a hat and sunglasses to protect yourself from the sun's rays. 
      By dressing appropriately for your fishing trip, you can help ensure a comfortable and safe experience 
      while enjoying the beautiful scenery of Lake Gatun.</p>

   <h3 class="name">Have fun </h3>
   <p class="address">Panama city, Calle 50 - Casa La Guama</p>
   <p>Having fun is perhaps the most important aspect of any fishing trip in Lake Gatun. 
     Fishing can be a relaxing and enjoyable activity, allowing you to disconnect from the stresses 
     of daily life and immerse yourself in nature. Whether you're fishing alone or with friends and family, 
     it's important to take the time to appreciate the beauty of your surroundings and enjoy the experience. <br/><br/>
     Don't get too caught up in the catch - remember that fishing is also about the process and the memories 
     you create along the way. Take the opportunity to appreciate the wildlife and the peacefulness of the lake. 
     By having fun and enjoying yourself, you can make the most of your fishing trip in Lake Gatun and create 
     lasting memories.</p>
