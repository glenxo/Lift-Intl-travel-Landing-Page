    <h2>Bring of sunscreen and insect repellent</h2>
    <p>When visiting Portobelo, it's important to be prepared for the tropical climate and the insects 
      that come with it. Bringing plenty of sunscreen and insect repellent is crucial for protecting your 
      skin from the intense sun and keeping bugs at bay. The sun in Portobelo can be particularly strong, 
      so it's important to reapply sunscreen regularly and wear protective clothing like hats and sunglasses.<br/><br/> 
      Insect repellent can also help prevent mosquito bites, which can carry diseases like Zika, dengue fever, 
      and chikungunya. By taking these simple precautions, you can enjoy all that Portobelo has to offer without
      worrying about sunburn or bug bites putting a damper on your trip.

    <p>If you're planning a trip to Portobelo, you might want to consider visiting during the

      to the region's rich Afro-Caribbean culture and is a feast for the senses. The festival features 
      colorful parades, lively music and dance performances, and traditional food and drinks. <br/><br/>

    <h3 class="name">Bring cash</h3>
    <p class="address">Panama city, 53rd St ave</p>
    <p>When traveling to Portobelo, it's important to bring cash with you, as many places in the town do 
      not accept credit cards. This includes small businesses like street vendors, as well as some restaurants 
      and shops. While there are a few ATMs in the town, they can be unreliable and may not always have cash on 
      hand. By bringing cash with you, you'll be able to make purchases and pay for services without worrying 
      about finding an ATM or struggling to find a place that accepts credit cards. <br/><br/>
      It's a good idea to bring 
      both small and large bills, as some places may not be able to make change for larger denominations. 
      By being prepared with cash, you'll be able to fully enjoy all that Portobelo has to offer without any 
      hassle or inconvenience.</p>
