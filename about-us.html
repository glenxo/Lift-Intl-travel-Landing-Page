         <h3>Lauren Johnston</h3>

         <p>This post is a bit delayed, but my husband and I really enjoyed our personal 
            tour with Richard. He is very knowledgeable, friendly and tailored the tour to 
            our interests. If we return to Panama, he will be called again..</p>

         <h3>Giulia Belloni</h3>

         <p>"I did the city tour including the Panama Canal with a friend, 
            and we were able to enjoy it. Richard provided us with an interesting 
            tour with historical and current information, was punctual, and tailored 
            it to our wishes. Since my friend is not very proficient in Spanish, he conducted 
            the tour in perfect English. All in all, highly recommended. üëçüèª"(translated from german)</p>

         <h3>Tiffanie Chavarria</h3>

         <p>Richard was the perfect tour guide, we took the horse 
            back/waterfall trip and it was amazing, he was very friendly 
            and outgoing, extremely knowledgeable and made sure we were 
            comfortable the whole time, and it was perfect he spoke English 
            and Spanish perfectly because my group had 2 only English speaking 
            and 1 only Spanish speaking so he did the best speaking to everyone 
            first in English and then in Spanish, he made sure not to leave anyone 
            out, the experience we had was amazing and we definitely look forward to 
            taking more trips with Richard, I highly recommend him, thank you again for 
            the amazing experience Richard..</p>

         <p>"Richard was an excellent guide. He picked us up on time, 
            took us on a tour of the Old Town, and then to the Panama Canal. 
            He was always informing us about the places we were passing by and 
            telling the history in great detail. Service and attention 10/10.".</p>
