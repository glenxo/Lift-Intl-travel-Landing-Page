        <p>Portobelo is a charming little town located on the northern coast of Panama, known for its rich history and 
          stunning natural beauty. It is a popular tourist destination due to its well-preserved colonial architecture, 
          world-class beaches, and a vibrant cultural scene.<br/>

          The town was founded in the 16th century by Spanish conquistadors and quickly became an important port for 
          transporting gold, silver, and other valuable commodities back to Europe. Today, visitors can explore the 
          impressive fortifications and ruins that remain from this time, including the San Lorenzo Castle and the Customs 
          House, both of which have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.<br/><br/>
          
          But Portobelo is not just about history - it also boasts some of the most beautiful beaches in Panama, 
          including Blanca and Isla Grande, which are perfect for swimming, sunbathing, and snorkeling. The town's 
          vibrant culture is on full display during the annual Congo festival, a celebration of Afro-Caribbean music, 
          
          dance, and art that draws visitors from all over the world.<br/>
          
          Whether you are interested in history, culture, or just soaking up the sun on a beautiful beach, 
          Portobelo has something to offer. So if you are planning a trip to Panama, make sure to put this gem 
          of a town on your itinerary!</p>

            <h2>Bring of sunscreen and insect repellent</h2>
                <p>When visiting Portobelo, it's important to be prepared for the tropical climate and the insects 
                  that come with it. Bringing plenty of sunscreen and insect repellent is crucial for protecting your 
                  skin from the intense sun and keeping bugs at bay. The sun in Portobelo can be particularly strong, 
                  so it's important to reapply sunscreen regularly and wear protective clothing like hats and sunglasses.<br/><br/> 
                  Insect repellent can also help prevent mosquito bites, which can carry diseases like Zika, dengue fever, 
                  and chikungunya. By taking these simple precautions, you can enjoy all that Portobelo has to offer without
                  worrying about sunburn or bug bites putting a damper on your trip.

            <h2>Bring cash</h2>
                <p>When traveling to Portobelo, it's important to bring cash with you, as many places in the town do 
                  not accept credit cards. This includes small businesses like street vendors, as well as some restaurants 
                  and shops. While there are a few ATMs in the town, they can be unreliable and may not always have cash on 
                  hand. By bringing cash with you, you'll be able to make purchases and pay for services without worrying 
                  about finding an ATM or struggling to find a place that accepts credit cards. <br/><br/>
                  It's a good idea to bring 
                  both small and large bills, as some places may not be able to make change for larger denominations. 
                  By being prepared with cash, you'll be able to fully enjoy all that Portobelo has to offer without any 
                  hassle or inconvenience.</p>

            <h2>Try some of the local cuisine</h2>
                <p>When visiting Portobelo, trying the local cuisine is a must-do. The town boasts a variety of 
                  delicious Afro-Caribbean dishes that are sure to delight your taste buds. Seafood lovers can 
                  indulge in fresh catches like lobster, shrimp, and fish, often served with rice and beans or plantains. 
                  Other local specialties include sancocho, a hearty stew made with chicken or beef, and carimañolas, 
                  deep-fried cassava rolls filled with meat or cheese. <br/><br/>
                  You can also try refreshing drinks like coconut 
                  water or chicha, a fermented corn drink. Many restaurants and street vendors in Portobelo offer these 
                  dishes and more, giving you a chance to sample the flavors of the area and experience the local culinary 
                  scene. Don't be afraid to ask locals for their recommendations - they'll be happy to share their favorite
